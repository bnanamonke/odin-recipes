            <li>&frac12; cup milk</li>
            <li>1 ounce red food color</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

        <h3>For the frosting:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces cream cheeses, softened</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sour cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>16 ounces sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
                 (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners. </li>
            <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and
                salt in a medium bowl; set aside. </li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer 
                on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. 
                Beat in eggs, one at a time.</li>
            <li>Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla. </li>
            <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended;
                do not over-beat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups,
                filling each &frac23; full. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake
                comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack
                for 5 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely. </li>
            <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese,
                butter, sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light
                and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth. </li>
            <li> Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes. </li>
        </ol>
